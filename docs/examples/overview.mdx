git clone https://github.com/go-mizu/examples
cd examples
go run ./001-hello-mizu
```

## Getting Started

1. [Hello, Mizu](./001-hello-mizu) - Your first web server
2. [Static Files](./002-static-files) - Serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. [Routing Basics](./003-routing-basics) - Define routes and handlers
4. [JSON Responses](./004-json-responses) - Return structured data
5. [Context and Lifecycle](./005-context-lifecycle) - Handle timeouts and cancellation
6. [Query, Form, and Path Parameters](./006-query-form-path) - Read request data
7. [Cookies](./007-cookies) - Store data between requests
8. [Middleware Basics](./008-middleware-basics) - Add logging, auth, and shared logic
9. [Error Handling and Recover](./009-error-handling-recover) - Handle errors and panics
10. [Logging with slog](./010-logging-with-slog) - Structured request logging

## What you will learn

By working through these examples, you will understand how to:

- Create routes and handlers
- Read data from requests (path, query, form, JSON)
- Send responses (text, JSON, HTML, files)
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Handle errors consistently
- Log requests and application events
