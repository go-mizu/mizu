Learning by examples is the best way to learn how to use **Mizu**.<br/>
*Mizu by Examples* is a practical, hands-on collection of runnable Go projects that guide you through building modern web applications step by step.

All examples are open source and available at [github.com/go-mizu/examples](https://github.com/go-mizu/examples).
You can clone the repository and start exploring right away:

```
git clone https://github.com/go-mizu/examples
cd examples
```

Each folder contains a small, focused Go program that demonstrates one clear idea: from serving pages to handling APIs, middleware, and real-time features.
Run any example instantly with a single command:

```
go run ./examples/001-hello-mizu
```

## How it is organized

The collection is divided into ten chapters, each focusing on a specific part of building Go web applications. Every chapter introduces new concepts while keeping the examples short and approachable.

#### Getting Started ✓

Learn the basics of creating servers, defining routes, and sending responses. You will build your first working web app in just a few lines of Go code.

- [Hello, Mizu](./001-hello-mizu)
- [Static Files](./002-static-files)
- [Routing Basics](./003-routing-basics)
- [JSON Responses](./004-json-responses)
- [Context and Lifecycle](./005-context-lifecycle)
- [Query, Form, and Path Parameters](./006-query-form-path)
- [Cookies and Sessions](./007-cookies-sessions)
- [Middleware Basics](./008-middleware-basics)
- [Error Handling and Recover](./009-error-handling-recover)
- [Logging with slog](./010-logging-with-slog)

#### HTTP Essentials ⏳

Understand how HTTP really works. Explore timeouts, request IDs, streaming responses, file uploads, and graceful shutdowns.

- [Request IDs and Correlation](./011-request-ids-correlation)
- [Timeout and Context Deadline](./012-timeout-context-deadline)
- [Method Override](./013-method-override)
- [Body Limit](./014-body-limit)
- [File Uploads](./015-file-uploads)
- [Streaming and Chunked Responses](./016-streaming-chunked-responses)
- [Custom Middleware](./017-custom-middleware)
- [Route Groups and Sub-Routers](./018-route-groups-sub-routers)
- [Graceful Shutdown](./019-graceful-shutdown)
- [Testing Mizu Apps](./020-testing-mizu-apps)

#### Security and Access 🔜

Add safety to your apps with CORS, CSRF protection, authentication, rate limiting, and secure headers.

#### Real-Time and WebSockets

Add live updates and push events with Server-Sent Events and WebSockets. Build interactive apps like chat systems and activity feeds.

#### Rendering and Views

Work with HTML templates, layouts, and static files to serve user interfaces that mix static and dynamic content.


#### Data and Persistence

Connect your app to databases such as SQLite or DuckLake. Learn how to query, manage transactions, and organize data access in a clear and idiomatic way.

#### Caching and Performance

Improve response times with in-memory caching, compression, and background jobs. Learn how to measure, profile, and optimize performance.


#### CLI and Tooling

Create command-line tools and configuration systems. Automate your development workflow and streamline how your app runs and deploys.

#### Full Applications

Combine everything into complete projects such as blogs, dashboards, and chat servers that demonstrate full-stack patterns.

#### Data Lakes and AI Agents

Explore advanced examples that merge data processing with intelligence. Use DuckLake for data storage and build AI-assisted workflows that query and respond to information dynamically.

### What you will learn

By completing this series, you will learn how to:

- Build web applications using Go and Mizu
- Write clear and composable handlers and middleware
- Connect to databases and add caching for performance
- Secure your applications and handle errors properly
- Add real-time features and experiment with intelligent data-driven components

Begin with [Hello, Mizu](./001-hello-mizu) and learn step by step at your own pace.
