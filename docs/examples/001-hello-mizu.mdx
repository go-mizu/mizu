Let's start with your first Mizu app. You will build a small web server that shows **Hello, Mizu** in your browser. It is a simple way to see how Mizu works while keeping everything clear and easy to follow.

Mizu uses Go's standard library under the hood, so if you have seen `net/http` before, this will look familiar.

### Code

Create a file called `main.go` and add this code:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/go-mizu/mizu"
)

// home handles requests to the root path ("/")
func home(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	return c.Text(http.StatusOK, "Hello, Mizu")
}

func main() {
	app := mizu.New()

	// Register the route
	app.Get("/", home)

	// Start the server
	if err := app.Listen(":8080"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

Here is what happens step by step:

* `mizu.New()` creates your web app.
* `app.Get("/", home)` connects the URL `/` to your `home` handler.
* `home()` sends a plain text message with status code `200 OK`.
* `app.Listen(":8080")` runs the server and waits for requests.

### Run

Open your terminal and run:

```
go run .
```

You will see:

```
Listening on :8080
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
You should see **Hello, Mizu** on the screen.

### How it works

When you visit `/`, Mizu matches that route and calls the `home` function.
Inside `home`, the line `c.Text(http.StatusOK, "Hello, Mizu")` sends a text response back to the browser with a 200 OK status.

This is the basic flow in every Mizu app: receive a request, handle it with a function, and send a response using the context `c`.

### Try something new

You can change the message to anything you like:

```go
func home(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	return c.Text(http.StatusOK, "Hello, Go!")
}
```

Or add another route:

```go
func about(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	return c.Text(http.StatusOK, "This is the about page.")
}

app.Get("/about", about)
```

Now if you visit [http://localhost:8080/about](http://localhost:8080/about), you will see your new page.

That is it, you have built your first Mizu web server.
