**001. Hello, Mizu**

Welcome to your very first Mizu lesson. In this lesson, you will create a simple web server that prints "Hello, Mizu" in your browser. It only takes a few lines of Go code and helps you understand how Mizu works from the very beginning.

Mizu is built directly on top of Go's standard library. That means if you have seen `net/http` before, this will feel natural. The goal here is just to get something running and see how Mizu handles requests and responses.

### Code

Let's look at the full program. You can copy this code into a file named `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"github.com/go-mizu/mizu"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new Mizu app
	app := mizu.New()

	// Define a simple route that responds to GET /
	app.Get("/", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
		// Send a plain text message back to the browser
		return c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu")
	})

	// Start the web server on port 8080
	if err := app.Listen(":8080"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

This short program does everything you need for a basic web server. It sets up an app, defines a route, sends a text response, and starts listening for connections.

Each part is simple to read. You can think of it like this:

- `mizu.New()` creates your app.
- `app.Get()` registers what should happen when someone visits a specific URL.
- Inside the function, `c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu")` sends a response.
- `app.Listen(":8080")` runs the server and waits for requests.

### Run the lesson

From the terminal, run the command:

```
go run .
```

You will see something like "Listening on :8080" in your terminal.
Then open your browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If everything is set up correctly, you will see the words **Hello, Mizu** on the screen.

### What is happening

When Mizu receives a request, it looks for a matching route. In this lesson, that route is `/`. When it finds a match, it runs the handler function you provided. Inside that function, you use the context `c` to send a response.

The code `c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu")` means: send a text response with the HTTP status code 200 and the message "Hello, Mizu". It is clear, readable, and very close to how the standard library works.

### Try something new

You can change the message inside `c.Text()` to something else, such as "Hello, Go!" or "Welcome to Mizu".

You can also create another route. For example:

```go
app.Get("/about", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	return c.Text(200, "This is the about page.")
})
```

Now when you visit [http://localhost:8080/about](http://localhost:8080/about), you will see the new message.

This small lesson shows how easy it is to get started with Mizu. You have built your first web server, handled a request, and sent a response all in a few clear lines of Go.
