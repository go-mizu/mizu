Mizu development follows a principle of incremental improvement. Each release adds focused functionality while keeping the core simple and stable.

### Current - Core Framework

The foundation is in place:

- Routing with Go 1.22 `ServeMux` patterns
- Context wrapper with request/response helpers
- Middleware system compatible with `net/http`
- Structured logging with `slog`
- Graceful shutdown with configurable timeouts
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) and streaming responses
- Static file serving
- Error handling with panic recovery

### Planned

Future development will focus on ecosystem packages that integrate with the core:

**Templates and Rendering**
- HTML templates with layouts and partials
- Integration with Go's `html/template`

**Testing Utilities**
- Test helpers for handlers and middleware
- Request/response mocking

**Documentation**
- More examples covering common patterns
- Guides for deployment and production use

### Philosophy

Mizu stays small by design. Features that require significant complexity will be separate packages rather than additions to the core. This keeps the framework predictable and easy to understand.

If you need functionality beyond what Mizu provides, you can use any Go library that works with `net/http`. Mizu does not lock you into a specific ecosystem.
