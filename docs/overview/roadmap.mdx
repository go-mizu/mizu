The roadmap shows how Mizu is growing step by step. Each stage focuses on a small, clear goal that improves the developer experience while keeping the core simple and stable.

### v0.1 - Core and Middleware

Focus on the foundation.
Routing, context, logging, recovery, and graceful shutdown.

### v0.2 - Real-Time and Streaming

Add real-time communication.
Server-Sent Events (SSE), WebSocket support, and streaming responses.

### v0.3 - Templates and Rendering

Bring rendering to life.
HTML templates, layouts, partials, and live reload for local development.

### v0.4 - Configuration and CLI

Make setup easier.
Environment file support, config loader, and a simple `mizu` command-line tool.

### v0.5 - Data and Persistence

Introduce database utilities.
Query builder, migrations, and connections for Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite.

### Future

Beyond v1.0, the focus is on expanding the ecosystem:
auth, background jobs, queues, caching, and community-driven packages.

Mizu aims to stay steady, predictable, and easy to learn.
Each release builds on the same principles: small steps, visible progress, and clear Go code.
