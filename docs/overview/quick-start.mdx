### Install

Start by installing Mizu with the `go get` command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/go-mizu/mizu
````

### Hello, Mizu 👋

Create a new file named `main.go` and add this code:

```go
package main

import "github.com/go-mizu/mizu"

func main() {
    app := mizu.New()

    app.Get("/", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
        return c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu 👋")
    })

    app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

### Run Your App

Run your app with:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Then open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You will see a friendly greeting: **Hello, Mizu 👋**

That's it! You have built your first Mizu app. From here, you can start adding routes, templates, and other features to bring your ideas to life.
