Mizu is a lightweight web framework for Go. The name means "water" in Japanese, reflecting the framework's goal: to flow naturally with Go's standard library rather than replacing it.

## What is Mizu?

Mizu helps you build web servers and APIs in Go. If you've used Python's Flask, Node's Express, or Ruby's Sinatra, Mizu fills a similar role but stays closer to how Go works.

A web framework handles the repetitive parts of building HTTP servers:
- **Routing**: Matching URLs like `/users/123` to your code
- **Request handling**: Reading data from forms, JSON bodies, and URLs
- **Response writing**: Sending back JSON, HTML, or files
- **Middleware**: Running shared code (logging, auth) before handlers

## What makes Mizu different?

Mizu adds a thin layer over Go's `net/http` package instead of replacing it:

| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Go 1.22 ServeMux patterns** | Routes like `/users/{id}` with path parameters | Uses the standard library, not a custom router |
| **Context wrapper** | `c.JSON()`, `c.Query()`, `c.Param()` helpers | Less boilerplate, cleaner handlers |
| **Error returns** | Handlers return errors directly | Central error handling, simpler code |
| **Graceful shutdown** | Finishes active requests before stopping | Safe deployments without dropped connections |
| **Structured logging** | Uses Go's `slog` package | JSON logs for production, readable logs for development |

Everything stays explicit. There is no reflection, code generation, or hidden behavior. If you know Go's `net/http`, you already understand how Mizu works.

## Who is Mizu for?

Mizu is a good fit if you:
- Know Go basics and want to build web APIs
- Prefer explicit code over "magic" conventions
- Want to use standard library patterns, not framework-specific ones
- Need a small, focused tool rather than a full-stack framework

Mizu is **not** for you if you want an opinionated framework with ORM, admin panels, and auth built in. For those needs, consider frameworks like Buffalo or Beego.

## A quick taste

Here's a complete Mizu server in 15 lines:

```go
package main

import "github.com/go-mizu/mizu"

func main() {
    app := mizu.New()

    app.Get("/", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
        return c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu!")
    })

    app.Get("/users/{id}", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
        id := c.Param("id")
        return c.JSON(200, map[string]string{"user_id": id})
    })

    app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

When this runs:
- Visiting `http://localhost:3000/` returns "Hello, Mizu!" as plain text
- Visiting `http://localhost:3000/users/42` returns `{"user_id":"42"}` as JSON
- Pressing Ctrl+C stops the server gracefully
