Mizu is a lightweight web framework for Go that focuses on simplicity and clarity.
The name *Mizu* means "water" in Japanese. It is designed to be clean, adaptable, and easy to flow with.

Everything in Mizu is written in plain Go. You define routes, handlers, and middleware the same way you would in standard Go code. There are no hidden abstractions or surprises.

Mizu helps you build web apps and APIs that stay easy to read, maintain, and extend over time. You can start with a single file and gradually grow into a full project structure without changing your coding style.
