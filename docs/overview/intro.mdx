Mizu is a lightweight web framework for Go. The name means "water" in Japanese.

Mizu adds a thin layer over Go's `net/http` package:

- Routes with path parameters using Go 1.22's `ServeMux`
- A context wrapper with helpers for JSON, forms, and cookies
- Middleware that works like standard Go handlers
- Graceful shutdown with configurable timeouts
- Structured logging with `slog`

Everything stays explicit. There is no reflection, code generation, or hidden behavior. If you know Go's `net/http`, you already understand how Mizu works.
