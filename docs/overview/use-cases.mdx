Mizu works well for many kinds of Go projects. Its small core and clear structure make it easy to use for any type of application.

- **APIs**: Build REST or RPC services with simple routes and clean handlers.
- **Web Apps**: Render HTML templates, handle forms, and serve static files in one place.
- **Microservices**: Create small, focused services that are easy to deploy, scale, and test.
- **Prototypes**: Turn ideas into working demos quickly with minimal setup.
- **SPA and Mobile Backends**: Serve JSON data for React, Vue, or mobile applications.
- **Internal Tools**: Build dashboards, admin panels, or monitoring pages using standard Go templates.
- **Real-Time Features**: Stream live updates, notifications, or logs using Go’s concurrency and WebSocket support.

Mizu gives you full control from start to finish.
You write plain Go code, add only what you need, and use the same tools whether you are building a small project or a large production system.
