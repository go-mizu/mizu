Mizu fits many kinds of Go projects. Its small core and clear structure make it easy to adapt to whatever you want to build.

- **APIs** - Build REST or RPC services with clean routes and simple handlers.
- **Web Apps** - Render HTML templates, manage forms, and serve static files in one place.
- **Microservices** - Create small, focused services that are easy to run, scale, and test.
- **Prototypes** - Turn ideas into working demos quickly with minimal setup.
- **SPA and Mobile Backends** - Serve JSON data for React, Vue, or mobile applications.
- **Internal Tools** - Build dashboards, admin panels, or monitoring pages using standard Go templates.
- **Real-Time Features** - Stream live updates, notifications, or logs using Go’s concurrency and WebSocket support.

Mizu stays flexible for both small side projects and large production systems.
You write plain Go, add only what you need, and keep full control from start to finish.
