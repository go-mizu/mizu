Mizu provides a focused set of features for building web applications in Go. Each feature is designed to feel familiar if you already know Go's standard library.

### Routing

- Go 1.22 `ServeMux` patterns with `{param}` path parameters
- HTTP method helpers: `Get`, `Post`, `Put`, `Patch`, `Delete`, and more
- Route groups with `Group()` and `Prefix()` for organizing endpoints
- Route-specific middleware with `With()`
- Mount any `http.Handler` for interoperability

### Request handling

- `c.Param("name")` for path parameters
- `c.Query("key")` and `c.QueryValues()` for query strings
- `c.Form()` for form data
- `c.MultipartForm()` for file uploads with automatic cleanup
- `c.BindJSON()` for JSON body parsing with size limits
- `c.Cookie()` for reading cookies
- `c.ClientIP()` for client IP detection

### Response helpers

- `c.Text()`, `c.JSON()`, `c.HTML()` for common response types
- `c.File()` and `c.Download()` for serving files
- `c.Stream()` for streaming responses
- `c.SSE()` for Server-Sent Events
- `c.Redirect()` and `c.NoContent()` for redirects and empty responses
- `c.Hijack()` for WebSocket upgrades and raw connections

### Middleware

- Simple function signature: `func(Handler) Handler`
- Global middleware with `app.Use()`
- Prepend middleware with `app.UseFirst()`
- Route-specific middleware with `app.With()`
- Compatible with standard `net/http` middleware via `Compat.Use()`

### Logging

- Built-in request logger using Go's `slog`
- Automatic color output for terminals
- JSON output for production environments
- Configurable with `LoggerOptions` for request IDs, user agent logging, and trace extraction
- Access logger from any handler with `c.Logger()`

### Error handling

- Return errors directly from handlers
- Central error handler with `app.ErrorHandler()`
- Automatic panic recovery with stack traces via `PanicError`
- Consistent error responses across your application

### Server lifecycle

- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Configurable pre-shutdown delay with `WithPreShutdownDelay()`
- Configurable shutdown timeout with `WithShutdownTimeout()`
- Health check endpoint with `app.HealthzHandler()`
- Support for `Listen()`, `ListenTLS()`, and `Serve()` with custom listeners

### Static files

- Serve files from disk with `app.Static()`
- Works with `http.Dir` or embedded filesystems via `http.FS`
- Automatic content-type detection

Mizu stays small and predictable. Everything is plain Go code with no hidden behavior.
