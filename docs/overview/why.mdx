The goal is to make building web servers in Go simple and enjoyable.
The Go standard library already provides powerful tools, but creating a full web app often means repeating the same setup for routing, logging, and requests. This framework saves time without hiding how Go works. It adds a clean, minimal layer that feels like writing plain Go code.

It is not a replacement for `net/http`. It builds on top of it.
You still use the same types, functions, and patterns you already know. The framework adds a small, reliable structure for routing, middleware, context, and error handling. If you have written Go before, it will feel natural right away.

#### Design Intent

The framework helps you stay productive while keeping full control over your code. It focuses on:

- clear and consistent data flow from request to response
- simple handlers that are easy to test and combine
- no reflection, code generation, or hidden behavior
- graceful startup and shutdown built into the core
- small, stable interfaces you can trust

Everything you write is regular Go code. There are no global states, configuration files, or background processes to manage.

#### Simplicity

Simplicity means always knowing what your code is doing.
Each feature is a small, readable piece you can inspect or extend. You can test routes with `httptest`, share handlers across services, or plug in standard middleware with no wrappers or adapters.

The framework stays out of your way. You can remove or replace any part without breaking the rest of your app. It is flexible enough for small projects and stable enough for larger ones.

#### Philosophy

It follows a few guiding ideas:

- **Clarity over magic** - code should do exactly what it shows
- **Composability** - build larger systems from small, simple parts
- **Performance by default** - efficient and lightweight without tuning
- **Interoperability** - works smoothly with Go’s standard packages
- **Predictable lifecycle** - startup, shutdown, and error handling are clear and consistent

Your applications stay fast, easy to understand, and simple to maintain.
You keep the Go you already know while getting a smoother, faster developer experience.
