Mizu provides powerful frontend integration that works with any modern JavaScript framework or server-rendered approach. Whether you're building a React SPA, a Vue application, or using HTMX for server-rendered HTML, Mizu has you covered.

## What is the Frontend Middleware?

The frontend middleware handles the complete lifecycle of serving frontend applications:

**In Development:**
- Proxies requests to your dev server (Vite, webpack, etc.)
- Enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates
- Proxies WebSocket connections for real-time development features
- Shows helpful error pages when the dev server is down

**In Production:**
- Serves optimized static files with intelligent caching
- Supports embedded filesystems for single-binary deployment
- Adds security headers automatically
- Implements SPA fallback routing for client-side navigation
- Handles asset fingerprinting and cache busting

## Supported Approaches

Mizu supports two main approaches to building frontends:

### Single Page Applications (SPAs)

SPAs are JavaScript-heavy applications that render in the browser. The server sends a minimal HTML page, and JavaScript handles routing and rendering.

**Popular SPA Frameworks:**
- **React** - The most popular UI library with a massive ecosystem
- **Vue** - Progressive framework with excellent developer experience
- **Svelte** - Compiler-based framework with minimal runtime
- **Angular** - Full-featured framework from Google
- **Preact** - Lightweight React alternative

**When to use SPAs:**
- Rich, interactive user interfaces
- Desktop-like web applications
- Apps that work well offline
- Applications with complex client-side state

### Server-Rendered Applications

Server-rendered apps generate HTML on the server and send it to the browser. JavaScript is used sparingly for interactivity.

**Popular Server-Rendering Approaches:**
- **HTMX** - Hypermedia-driven approach with minimal JavaScript
- **Alpine.js** - Lightweight JavaScript for progressive enhancement
- **Go Templates** - Pure server-side rendering

**When to use server-rendering:**
- Content-heavy websites
- SEO-critical applications
- Apps that need to work without JavaScript
- Simpler applications with less interactivity
- Teams that prefer server-side logic

### Hybrid Frameworks

Some frameworks support both approaches:

- **Next.js** (React) - Server-Side Rendering, Static Generation, or SPA
- **Nuxt** (Vue) - Server-Side Rendering, Static Generation, or SPA
- **SvelteKit** (Svelte) - Server-Side Rendering or Static Generation

With Mizu, these frameworks typically use their **static generation** mode, where the frontend is pre-built and Mizu serves the static files.

## How It Works

### Development Mode

When you run your app in development:

```
Your Browser → Mizu Server → Frontend Dev Server (Vite)
               ↑                      ↓
               └──── Proxies ─────────┘
```

1. You make a request to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Mizu checks if it's an API route (e.g., `/api/*`)
3. If not, Mizu proxies the request to your frontend dev server
4. The dev server responds with the latest code
5. HMR WebSocket connections are also proxied for live reload

### Production Mode

When you deploy your app:

```
Your Browser → Mizu Server → Static Files (dist/)
                           → API Handlers
```

1. You build your frontend (e.g., `npm run build`)
2. Mizu serves the built files from the `dist` folder
3. API routes are handled by your Go handlers
4. Frontend routes fall back to `index.html` for SPA routing
5. Assets are cached aggressively based on their fingerprint

## Auto-Detection

Mizu can automatically detect whether to run in development or production mode based on environment variables:

```go
app.Use(frontend.WithOptions(frontend.Options{
    Mode:      frontend.ModeAuto,        // Auto-detect
    Root:      "./dist",                  // Production files
    DevServer: "http://localhost:5173",   // Dev server URL
}))
```

The mode is determined by the `MIZU_ENV`, `GO_ENV`, or `ENV` environment variable:
- `production` or `prod` → Production mode
- Anything else → Development mode

## Choosing an Approach

Not sure which approach to use? Here's a decision guide:

| Question | SPA | Server-Rendered |
|----------|-----|----------------|
| Need rich interactivity? | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited |
| SEO is critical? | ⚠️ Requires SSR | ✅ Yes |
| Team knows JavaScript frameworks? | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Maybe |
| Simple CRUD app? | ⚠️ Overkill | ✅ Perfect |
| Offline support needed? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Fast initial page load? | ⚠️ Slower | ✅ Faster |
| Large team? | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Depends |

**General guidance:**
- **Start simple**: If you're unsure, start with HTMX or Alpine.js
- **Go SPA**: If you need a desktop-like experience or complex state
- **Hybrid approach**: Use HTMX for most pages, React for complex features

## Quick Comparison

### HTMX Example

```go
// Server sends complete HTML fragments
app.Get("/users", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
    users := getUsers()
    return c.Render("users.html", users)
})
```

```html
<!-- Clicking loads HTML from server -->
<button hx-get="/users" hx-target="#user-list">
    Load Users
</button>
<div id="user-list"></div>
```

### React Example

```go
// Server provides JSON API
app.Get("/api/users", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
    users := getUsers()
    return c.JSON(200, users)
})
```

```jsx
// React fetches and renders client-side
function UserList() {
    const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/users')
            .then(r => r.json())
            .then(setUsers);
    }, []);

    return <div>{users.map(u => <User key={u.id} {...u} />)}</div>;
}
```

Notice the difference:
- **HTMX**: Server sends HTML, minimal JavaScript
- **React**: Server sends JSON, React renders HTML
