Deploying a Mizu app is very similar to running any Go program. You build a binary, copy it to a server, and run it. The process is simple and does not need any special tools.

### Build your app

Open a terminal inside your project folder and build the app.
If you are building for Linux from a macOS or Windows computer, use:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o app
```

This command tells Go to compile your program for Linux 64-bit systems.
It creates a small executable file named `app` in your project folder.

Now you have a single binary file that contains your Mizu app.

### Run on a server

Upload the file to your server.
If you are using SSH, you can copy it with this command:

```bash
scp app user@server:/opt/mizu/app
```

Then log in and start the server:

```bash
ssh user@server
cd /opt/mizu
PORT=3000 ENV=production ./app
```

Your app will start listening on port 3000.
Open a browser and go to `http://your-server:3000` to see it running.
If the page does not load, check that the port is open in your firewall settings.

### Keep it running

When you close your SSH session, the app will stop.
To keep it running in the background, use a small process manager like `systemd`.

Create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/mizu.service` with this content:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/mizu/app
Restart=always
Environment=PORT=3000
```

Then enable and start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mizu
sudo systemctl start mizu
```

You can check the logs anytime:

```bash
journalctl -u mizu -f
```

### Add HTTPS

To make your app available over HTTPS, set up a reverse proxy.
Caddy is one of the easiest ways to do this, because it can get certificates automatically.

Example Caddyfile:

```
yourdomain.com {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

Reload Caddy to apply the change:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

Now you can open your app with `https://yourdomain.com`.

### Deploy with Docker

If you prefer Docker, you can package your app in a container.
Create a `Dockerfile` like this:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.23 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /app

FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12
COPY --from=build /app /app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["/app"]
```

Then build and run your container:

```bash
docker build -t mizu-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 mizu-app
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to confirm it is running.
Docker is useful when you want consistent deployments across different machines.
