This guide shows how to create a simple Mizu app from scratch.
If you have used Go before, you will feel right at home.

### Install Mizu

Run this command inside your Go project to install Mizu.

```bash
go get github.com/go-mizu/mizu@latest
```

That is all you need. No extra setup or tools required.

### Write your first app

Create a file called `main.go` and add this code.

```go
package main

import "github.com/go-mizu/mizu"

func main() {
	app := mizu.New()

	app.Get("/", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
		return c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu!")
	})

	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

### Run the app

Start your server with:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
You should see "Hello, Mizu!" on the page.

### What's next

Now that your first app is running, you can:

- Add routes and return JSON or HTML responses.
- Use middleware for logging and recovery.
- Learn about graceful shutdowns for production use.

Mizu keeps things simple. You write normal Go code, and it takes care of the details.
