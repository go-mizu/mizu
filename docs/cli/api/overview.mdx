description: "Production-ready JSON API with feature-based organization"
---

The API template creates a well-structured JSON API service. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for programs to talk to each other - when you build an API, you create endpoints (URLs) that other programs can call to get or send data, usually in JSON format. This template is designed for production use with a clean architecture that scales as your project grows.

## When to Use This Template

Use the API template when:

- **Building a REST API** - JSON endpoints for web or mobile clients
- **Multiple developers** - Clear structure everyone can follow
- **Production service** - Ready for deployment
- **Need organization** - More than a few routes

## What You Get

A complete project structure with:

- **Feature-based organization** - Code grouped by domain
- **Configuration management** - Environment-based config
- **App lifecycle** - Clean startup and shutdown
- **Example endpoints** - Health check, echo, users

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create the project
mizu new myapi --template api

# Enter the project
cd myapi

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run the server
mizu dev
```

Test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users
```

## Project Structure

```

├── cmd/
│   └── api/
│       └── main.go         # Entry point
├── app/
│   └── api/

└── .gitignore
```

## Key Features

### Feature-Based Organization

Each feature (domain/module) gets its own folder:

```
feature/
├── users/     # User management
├── products/  # Product catalog
├── orders/    # Order processing
└── auth/      # Authentication
```

This keeps related code together and makes it easy to find things.

### Configuration Management

Configuration is loaded from environment variables:

```go
type Config struct {
    Addr string // Server address
    Dev  bool   // Development mode
}

func LoadConfig() Config {
    return Config{
        Addr: getEnv("ADDR", ":8080"),
        Dev:  getEnv("DEV", "true") == "true",
    }
}
```

### Application Structure

The `App` struct manages lifecycle:

```go
type App struct {
    cfg Config
    app *mizu.App
}

func New(cfg Config) *App {
    a := &App{cfg: cfg}
    a.app = mizu.New()
    a.routes()
    return a
}
```

## Example Routes

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

### Hello Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
```

```
Hello from myapi
```

### Users API

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users
```

```json
[{"id":"1","name":"Alice"},{"id":"2","name":"Bob"}]
```

### Echo Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/echo -d '{"message":"hi"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```json
{"message":"hi"}
```

## Why This Structure?

### Scalability

As your API grows, add new features without cluttering existing code:

```bash
# Add a new feature
mkdir -p feature/products
touch feature/products/http.go
```

### Testability

Each feature can be tested independently:

```bash
go test ./feature/users/...
go test ./feature/products/...
```

### Team Collaboration

Clear boundaries mean less merge conflicts:

- Developer A works on `feature/users/`
- Developer B works on `feature/products/`

### Maintainability

Find code easily:

- "Where's the user creation logic?" → `feature/users/`
- "Where are routes defined?" → `app/api/routes.go`
- "Where's the config?" → `app/api/config.go`

## Comparison with Minimal

| Aspect | minimal | api |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Files | 1 | 10+ |
| Structure | None | Feature-based |
| Config | Hardcoded | Environment variables |
| Suitable for | Learning, prototypes | Production |
| Scalability | Poor | Good |
