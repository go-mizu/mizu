# mizu version

The `mizu version` command shows information about the installed Mizu CLI, including the version number, Go version, and build details.

## Basic Usage

```bash
mizu version
```

Output:

```
mizu version 0.1.0
go version: go1.23.0
commit: abc1234
built: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

## What Each Field Means

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `version` | The semantic version of the CLI | `0.1.0` |
| `go version` | The Go version used to compile | `go1.23.0` |
| `commit` | Short Git commit hash | `abc1234` |
| `built` | When this version was built (UTC) | `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` |

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |
| `-h, --help` | Show help |

## JSON Output

For scripts and automation, use `--json`:

```bash
mizu version --json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "go_version": "go1.23.0",
  "commit": "abc1234",
  "built_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## When to Use This Command

### Verify Installation

After installing the CLI, confirm it's working:

```bash
mizu version
```

If you see version information, the CLI is installed correctly.

### Check for Updates

Compare your version with the latest release:

```bash
# Check your version
mizu version

# Update to latest
go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest

# Verify update
mizu version
```

### Include in Bug Reports

When reporting issues, include your version information:

```bash
mizu version --json > version.json
```

Share this file with your bug report so maintainers know your exact setup.

### CI/CD Version Checks

Ensure a minimum version in build scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the version
VERSION=$(mizu version --json | jq -r '.version')

# Compare versions (requires semver comparison)
if [[ "$VERSION" == "dev" ]]; then
  echo "Warning: Using development build"
fi

echo "Using mizu $VERSION"
```

## Development Builds

If you built from source without setting version flags, you'll see:

```
mizu version dev
go version: go1.23.0
commit: unknown
built: unknown
```

This is normal for local development builds.

## Setting Build Information

When building the CLI, you can embed version information using Go's `-ldflags`:

```bash
go build -ldflags "\
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.Version=1.0.0 \
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.Commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.BuildTime=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -o mizu ./cmd/mizu
```

This is useful for:
- Release builds
- CI/CD pipelines
- Custom distribution

### Variables

| Variable | Default |
|----------|---------|
| `cli.Version` | `dev` |
| `cli.Commit` | `unknown` |
| `cli.BuildTime` | `unknown` |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Success (always) |

The version command always succeeds if the CLI is running.

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: mizu"

The CLI isn't installed or isn't in your PATH. See [Installation](/cli/installation).

### Version Shows "dev"

You're running a development build. This is fine for testing but you may want to install a release version:

```bash
go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```
