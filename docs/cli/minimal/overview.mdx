# Minimal Template

The minimal template creates the smallest possible runnable Mizu application. It's a single Go file with just enough code to start a web server.

## When to Use This Template

Use the minimal template when:

- **Learning Mizu** - Understand the basics without distractions
- **Quick experiments** - Test an idea in minutes
- **Custom structure** - You want to build your own project layout
- **Embedding examples** - Need a simple example to share

## What You Get

A single-file application with:

- One Go file (`main.go`)
- A basic route that returns "Hello"
- A running server on port 8080

That's it. No extra folders, no configuration files, just the essentials.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create the project
mizu new hello --template minimal

# Enter the project
cd hello

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run the server
mizu dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. You'll see:

```
Hello from hello
```

## What the Code Looks Like

The entire application fits in one file:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/go-mizu/mizu"
)

func main() {
    app := mizu.New()

    app.Get("/", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
        return c.Text(200, "Hello from minimal\n")
    })

    log.Println("listening on :8080")
    if err := app.Listen(":8080"); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

Let's break this down:

1. **Create the app** - `mizu.New()` creates a new Mizu application
2. **Add a route** - `app.Get("/", ...)` handles GET requests to the root path
3. **Return a response** - `c.Text(200, "...")` sends a plain text response
4. **Start the server** - `app.Listen(":8080")` starts the HTTP server

## Why Start Minimal?

### Easy to Understand

With just 20 lines of code, you can see exactly what Mizu does:
- Creates an HTTP server
- Routes requests to handlers
- Sends responses

### Easy to Modify

Want to try something? Just edit the one file:

```go
// Add a JSON endpoint
app.Get("/api/user", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
    return c.JSON(200, map[string]string{
        "name": "Alice",
        "role": "admin",
    })
})
```

### Easy to Grow

When you're ready for more structure, you can:
1. Add new files to the same directory
2. Migrate to the `api` template
3. Build your own custom structure

## Comparison with Other Templates

| Aspect | minimal | api |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Files | 1 | 10+ |
| Folders | 0 | 5+ |
| Lines of code | ~20 | ~200 |
| Learning curve | Minutes | Hours |
| Production ready | No | Yes |

## When to Upgrade

Consider switching to the `api` template when:

- You have more than 3-4 routes
- You need configuration management
- Multiple developers are working on the project
- You want feature-based organization
