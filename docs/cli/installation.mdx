---

This guide will help you install the Mizu CLI on your computer. We'll cover everything from checking prerequisites to verifying your installation works. Even if you've never installed a command-line tool before, you'll be able to follow along.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Mizu CLI, you need Go installed on your computer.

### What is Go?

Go (also called Golang) is the programming language that Mizu is built with. The Mizu CLI is a Go program, so you need Go to install and run it.

### Check if Go is Installed

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```

If Go is installed, you'll see something like:

```
go version go1.23.0 darwin/arm64
```

If you see "command not found", you need to install Go first.

### Install Go

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    **Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    brew install go
    ```

    **Option 2: Download from golang.org**
    1. Go to https://go.dev/dl/
    2. Download the macOS installer (.pkg file)
    3. Run the installer
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    **Ubuntu/Debian:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install golang-go
    ```

    **Fedora:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install golang
    ```

    **Or download from golang.org:**
    ```bash
    # Download (check go.dev for latest version)
    wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

    # Extract to /usr/local
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

    # Add to PATH (add this to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1. Go to https://go.dev/dl/
    2. Download the Windows installer (.msi file)
    3. Run the installer
    4. Restart your terminal/command prompt
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After installing Go, verify it works:

```bash
go version
```

<Note>
**Go Version Requirements:** The Mizu CLI requires Go 1.22 or later. If you have an older version, please upgrade.
</Note>

## Install the Mizu CLI

Now you're ready to install the Mizu CLI. The easiest way is using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```

This command:
1. Downloads the Mizu CLI source code
2. Compiles it on your computer
3. Installs the `mizu` binary to your Go bin directory

### Where is the Binary Installed?

The `mizu` binary is installed to `$GOPATH/bin`. You can find this location by running:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

This will show something like:
- **macOS/Linux:** `/Users/yourname/go` or `/home/yourname/go`
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\yourname\go`

The binary is in the `bin` folder inside that directory.

## Add Go Bin to Your PATH

For the `mizu` command to work from anywhere, the Go bin directory must be in your PATH.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux (Bash)">
    Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
    ```

    Then reload your shell:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux (Zsh)">
    Add this line to your `~/.zshrc`:
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
    ```

    Then reload your shell:
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter
    2. Click "Advanced" tab
    3. Click "Environment Variables"
    4. Under "User variables", find "Path" and click "Edit"
    5. Click "New" and add: `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`
    6. Click "OK" to save
    7. Restart your terminal
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify the CLI is working:

```bash
mizu version
```

You should see output like:

```
mizu version 0.1.0
go version: go1.23.0
commit: abc1234
built: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

If you see this, the installation was successful.

## Install from Source

If you want to build from source (for development or to get the latest unreleased changes):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/go-mizu/mizu.git
cd mizu

# Build the CLI
go build -o mizu ./cmd/mizu

# Move to a directory in your PATH
# macOS/Linux:
sudo mv mizu /usr/local/bin/

# Or move to Go bin:
mv mizu $(go env GOPATH)/bin/
```

### Build with Version Information

For production builds, you can embed version information:

```bash
go build -ldflags "\
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.Version=1.0.0 \
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.Commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.BuildTime=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -o mizu ./cmd/mizu
```

## Updating the CLI

To update to the latest version:

```bash
go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```

This downloads and installs the newest version, replacing the old one.

## Shell Completion

You can set up tab completion for command names. This lets you press Tab to autocomplete commands.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bash">
    Add to your `~/.bashrc`:
    ```bash
    complete -W "new dev contract version" mizu
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Zsh">
    Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
    ```zsh
    compctl -k "(new dev contract version)" mizu
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: mizu"

This means your terminal can't find the `mizu` binary. The most common cause is that Go's bin directory isn't in your PATH.

**Fix:**

1. Check where Go installs binaries:
   ```bash
   go env GOPATH
   ```

2. Check if the binary exists:
   ```bash
   ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin/mizu
   ```

3. If the binary exists but the command doesn't work, add Go bin to your PATH (see above).

4. After updating PATH, restart your terminal or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

### "go: command not found"

Go is not installed or not in your PATH. Follow the Go installation instructions above.

### "permission denied"

If you get permission errors:

**Option 1:** Use sudo (not recommended for go install)
```bash
sudo go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```

**Option 2:** Set GOPATH to a directory you own (recommended)
```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```

### Build Errors

If you get compilation errors when installing:

1. Make sure you have Go 1.22 or later:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. Clear Go's module cache and try again:
   ```bash
   go clean -modcache
   go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
   ```

### Verify Go Environment

If you're having trouble, check your Go environment:

```bash
go env
```

Key variables to check:
- `GOPATH`: Where Go stores packages and binaries
- `GOROOT`: Where Go itself is installed
- `GOBIN`: Where binaries are installed (defaults to `$GOPATH/bin`)
