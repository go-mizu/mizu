# Installation

There are several ways to install the Mizu CLI on your system.

## Using Go Install (Recommended)

The simplest way to install the Mizu CLI is using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```

This will download, compile, and install the `mizu` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

<Note>
Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable to run `mizu` from anywhere.
</Note>

## From Source

Clone the repository and build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/go-mizu/mizu.git
cd mizu

# Build the CLI
go build -o mizu ./cmd/mizu

# Move to your PATH (optional)
sudo mv mizu /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build with Version Information

For production builds, include version information:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.Version=1.0.0 \
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.Commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  -X github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cli.BuildTime=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -o mizu ./cmd/mizu
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify the CLI is working:

```bash
mizu version
```

Expected output:

```
mizu version 0.1.0
go version: go1.24
commit: abc1234
built: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

## Shell Completion

The Mizu CLI provides completion suggestions. Configure your shell:

### Bash

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
complete -W "new dev version" mizu
```

### Zsh

```zsh
# Add to ~/.zshrc
compctl -k "(new dev version)" mizu
```

## Updating

To update the CLI to the latest version:

```bash
go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```

## Requirements

- **Go 1.21+** - Required for building and running the CLI
- **Git** - Required for version information in builds

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If you get `command not found: mizu`, ensure your Go bin directory is in your PATH:

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Then reload your shell or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Permission Denied

If you get permission errors when installing globally:

```bash
# Option 1: Use sudo
sudo go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest

# Option 2: Install to user directory (recommended)
GOPATH=$HOME/go go install github.com/go-mizu/mizu/cmd/mizu@latest
```
