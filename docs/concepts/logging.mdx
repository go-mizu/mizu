Mizu uses Go’s `slog` package for structured, consistent logging.
You can log messages inside any handler or middleware using `c.Logger()`, or configure a global logger for your entire application.

### Basic logging

Every request in Mizu has its own logger.
You can use it to record information while processing a request.

```go
app.Get("/", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	c.Logger().Info("handling request", "path", c.Request().URL.Path)
	return c.Text(200, "ok")
})
```

By default, Mizu prints logs in text format for development and JSON format for production.

### Set a custom logger

You can set a custom logger that all handlers and middleware will use.

```go
logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
app.SetLogger(logger)
```

All logs created with `c.Logger()` will use this logger.

### Request logging middleware

Mizu provides a built-in logging middleware that records basic details for every request.

```go
app.Use(mizu.Logger(mizu.LoggerOptions{}))
```

You can adjust how it works with options.

```go
app.Use(mizu.Logger(mizu.LoggerOptions{
	Mode:      mizu.Dev,   // or mizu.Prod
	Color:     true,        // enable colors in development
	UserAgent: true,        // include User-Agent in logs
}))
```

This middleware logs the method, path, response time, and status code for each request.

### Logging levels

You can use standard log levels anywhere in your code.

```go
c.Logger().Debug("debug message")
c.Logger().Info("processing request", "id", 42)
c.Logger().Warn("slow response", "duration", "200ms")
c.Logger().Error("failed to save", "err", err)
```

These levels help separate development messages, runtime events, and actual errors.

### Development mode

Enable developer mode to get colorized logs and automatic request logging.

```go
app.Dev(true)
```

This switches logging to a text-based format and makes it easier to read during development.

### Example

```go
app.Dev(true)

app.Get("/hello", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	c.Logger().Info("say hello")
	return c.Text(200, "Hello")
})
```

Structured logs make it simple to follow requests, measure response times, and debug problems while keeping your output clean and readable.
