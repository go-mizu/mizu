A Mizu application is the main part of your web server. <br/>
It creates the router, manages middleware, runs the HTTP server, and handles shutdown safely when the server stops.

### Create an app

Every Mizu project begins by creating an `App` instance.

```go
package main

import "github.com/go-mizu/mizu"

func home(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	return c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu!")
}

func main() {
	app := mizu.New()
	app.Get("/", home)
	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

`mizu.New()` creates a new app.<br/>
`app.Get()` adds a route.<br/>
`app.Listen()` starts the server on the given port.<br/>
When you visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), the server responds with "Hello, Mizu!".

### How it works

The `App` type includes Mizu's `Router`, so you can define routes and middleware on it directly.<br/>
When `Listen` is called, Mizu starts a standard Go `net/http` server.<br/>
When the server receives a stop signal, Mizu performs a graceful shutdown and lets running requests finish first.

Mizu automatically handles:

- Graceful shutdown when system signals are received
- Structured logging for startup and shutdown
- Panic recovery in handlers to prevent crashes

### Health checks

You can add a health check endpoint for monitoring.<br/>
This helps detect when the server is ready or shutting down.

```go
http.Handle("/healthz", app.HealthzHandler())
```

The endpoint returns `200 OK` when running and `503 Service Unavailable` during shutdown.<br/>
It works with load balancers and orchestration tools such as Kubernetes.

### Next steps

Once your app is running, learn more about these topics:

- [Handler](/concepts/handler) to write request logic
- [Logging](/concepts/logging) to record activity and errors
- [Error](/concepts/error) to manage errors in one place
