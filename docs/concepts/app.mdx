A Mizu application is the core of your server.
It creates the router, manages middleware, runs the HTTP server, and shuts down gracefully when stopped.

### Create an app

Every project starts by creating an `App` instance:

```go
package main

import "github.com/go-mizu/mizu"

func main() {
	app := mizu.New()

	app.Get("/", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
		return c.Text(200, "Hello, Mizu!")
	})

	app.Listen(":3000")
}
````

`mizu.New()` builds the app.
`app.Get()` adds a route, and `app.Listen()` starts the server.

### How it works

`App` embeds Mizu’s `Router`, so you can define routes and middleware directly on it.
When you call `Listen`, Mizu starts a `net/http` server, listens for requests, and manages graceful shutdown when the process receives a stop signal.

Mizu automatically handles:

- Graceful shutdown with OS signals
- Logging for start and stop events
- Panic recovery inside handlers

### Health checks

You can expose a readiness endpoint with:

```go
http.Handle("/healthz", app.HealthzHandler())
```

It returns `200 OK` when running and `503` when shutting down.

### Next steps

* [Routing](/concepts/routing) – define routes and methods
* [Handler](/concepts/handler) – write business logic
* [Logging](/concepts/logging) – integrate structured logging
* [Error](/concepts/error) – handle application errors in one place
