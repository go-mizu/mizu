Mizu is designed to feel like Go itself: clear, small, and predictable.
It adds only the essentials you need for real applications without hiding how Go works.

#### [App](/concepts/app)

Start with a single file or scale into a full application.
Mizu provides small building blocks that grow with your project instead of locking you into a strict structure.

#### [Routing](/concepts/routing)

Define routes using plain Go.
No annotations or code generation—just simple, readable functions that are easy to test and compose.

#### [Handler](/concepts/handler)

Handlers are just Go functions that return an error.
Mizu takes care of error handling so you can focus on the logic.

#### [Context](/concepts/context)

Every request has a `Ctx` that wraps `net/http` and adds small, useful helpers for headers, logging, and responses.

#### [Request](/concepts/request)

Read path parameters, queries, headers, forms, or JSON input with simple methods.
No reflection or hidden parsing.

#### [Response](/concepts/response)

Send text, JSON, HTML, or files directly through `Ctx`.
Mizu keeps it consistent and close to the standard library.

#### [Static](/concepts/static)

Serve assets like images, CSS, or JavaScript easily from a local or embedded directory.
No setup scripts or plugins required.

#### [Logging](/concepts/logging)

Use structured logging powered by Go’s `slog`.
Log within any handler or middleware with simple, consistent output for both development and production.

#### [Error](/concepts/error)

Handle all errors in one place.
Mizu lets you define a single global error handler that catches both returned errors and panics, keeping your code predictable and clean.
