Every handler in Mizu uses a `*mizu.Ctx` to send responses.
You can return text, JSON, HTML, files, or streams easily without working directly with `http.ResponseWriter`.

### Set status codes

You can set a status code before writing the response body.

```go
c.Status(202)
return c.Text(0, "Accepted")
```

If you pass `0` as the status code, Mizu uses the one already set.
You can check it anytime.

```go
code := c.StatusCode()
c.Logger().Info("status", "code", code)
```

### Send text

Send a plain text response.

```go
return c.Text(200, "Hello, world")
```

If the text is not valid UTF-8, it will be written as binary data.

### Send JSON

Send structured data as JSON.

```go
return c.JSON(200, map[string]any{
	"message": "ok",
	"id":      1,
})
```

The content type is automatically set to `application/json; charset=utf-8`.
If you pass `0`, Mizu keeps the current status code.

### Send HTML

Send HTML content.

```go
return c.HTML(200, "<h1>Welcome</h1>")
```

The response will include `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`.

### Work with headers

You can set or check headers directly.

```go
c.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "no-store")
c.HeaderIfNone("Content-Type", "text/plain")
```

Set headers before writing the body so they are included in the response.

### Redirect

Redirect the client to another page.

```go
return c.Redirect(302, "/login")
```

If you pass `0`, the default is `302 Found`.

### No content

Send an empty response with status code 204.

```go
return c.NoContent()
```

### Serve files and downloads

Serve files directly from disk.

```go
return c.File("./public/logo.png")
```

Send files as downloads.

```go
return c.Download("./report.csv", "report.csv")
```

Mizu uses standard Go file serving, so range requests and caching work automatically.

### Stream data

Send data gradually as it becomes available.

```go
return c.Stream(func(w io.Writer) error {
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "chunk %d\n", i)
	}
	return nil
})
```

### Server-Sent Events

Send live updates to the client using Server-Sent Events.

```go
ch := make(chan any)
go func() {
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		ch <- map[string]int{"count": i}
	}
	close(ch)
}()
return c.SSE(ch)
```

### Low-level control

For more control, you can access lower-level response features.

```go
_ = c.Flush()
conn, rw, _ := c.Hijack()
_ = c.SetWriteDeadline(time.Now().Add(5 * time.Second))
_ = c.EnableFullDuplex()
```

These allow you to handle websockets, raw connections, or long-lived responses using normal Go behavior.
