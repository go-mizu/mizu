Each handler in Mizu receives a `*mizu.Ctx`.
It gives you access to the request, response, and tools like the logger and context cancellation.

### Access request and response

```go
req := c.Request()
res := c.Response()
```

You can still use all helpers like `c.Query()` or `c.JSON()`, but these give you full access to the underlying Go types if needed.

### Logger

Every request has a logger you can use for structured logs.

```go
c.Logger().Info("processing", "path", c.Request().URL.Path)
```

### Request context

Use the built-in context for cancellation or deadlines.

```go
select {
case <-c.Context().Done():
	return c.Context().Err()
default:
}
```

### Headers

You can read or set headers directly.

```go
c.Header().Set("X-App", "mizu")
```

### Example

```go
app.Get("/ping", func(c *mizu.Ctx) error {
	c.Logger().Info("ping")
	return c.Text(200, "pong")
})
```

`Ctx` keeps everything connected—request, response, and logging—without hiding Go’s standard behavior.
