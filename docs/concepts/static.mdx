Mizu makes it easy to serve static files with the `Static` method on the router.
You can mount any directory or embedded filesystem at a URL path.

### Serve files from a local directory

If you have a `public/` folder with assets like CSS and images:

```go
app := mizu.New()
app.Static("/assets/", http.Dir("public"))
app.Listen(":3000")
```

This serves `public/logo.png` at `http://localhost:3000/assets/logo.png`.

The path should end with a `/` to match all files under that directory.

### Use Go's embedded filesystem

You can use Go's `embed` package to include files inside your binary.

```go
import (
	"embed"
	"github.com/go-mizu/mizu"
	"net/http"
)

//go:embed public/*
var publicFS embed.FS

func main() {
	app := mizu.New()
	app.Static("/assets/", http.FS(publicFS))
	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

Now your app can serve assets without needing external files at runtime.

### Mount external handlers

You can also mount any standard `http.Handler` at a specific route:

```go
fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("uploads"))
app.Mount("/files", http.StripPrefix("/files", fs))
```

This lets you integrate static serving with other routers or libraries that use `net/http`.
