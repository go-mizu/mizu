Mizu can serve static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript using the `Static` method on the router.<br/>
You can serve files from a local directory or from Go's embedded filesystem.

### Serve files from a local directory

If you have a `public/` folder containing assets:

```go
app := mizu.New()
app.Static("/assets/", http.Dir("public"))
app.Listen(":3000")
```

This makes `public/logo.png` available at `http://localhost:3000/assets/logo.png`.
You do not have to include the trailing slash in the prefix — Mizu automatically adds it internally.

### Serve embedded files

You can include static files directly in your Go binary using the `embed` package.
To serve files correctly, use `fs.Sub` to remove the folder prefix.

```go
import (
	"embed"
	"io/fs"
	"net/http"
	"github.com/go-mizu/mizu"
)

//go:embed public/*
var publicFS embed.FS

func main() {
	app := mizu.New()

	sub, err := fs.Sub(publicFS, "public")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	app.Static("/assets/", http.FS(sub))
	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

This serves `/assets/logo.png` from the embedded file `public/logo.png`.

### Mount external handlers

You can mount any standard `http.Handler` at a specific path.
This works well with `http.FileServer` or other middleware built for `net/http`.

```go
fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("uploads"))
app.Mount("/files", http.StripPrefix("/files", fs))
```

Mizu's `Static` method works the same way internally, using `http.FileServer` and `http.StripPrefix` to ensure correct path handling.
